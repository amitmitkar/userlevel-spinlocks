This is a simple userlevel spinlock implementation primarily to illustrate the
difference between TAS ( Test And Set ) and ( Test Test and Set ) idioms of
locking. It is specific to x86.


COMPILE : 

	To compile simply run make clean all.
        Please note that the code makes use of a lot of new API functions in
	both libc and libpthread. So make sure you are running a fairly recent
        Linux distro. I built it on Fedora 14.
